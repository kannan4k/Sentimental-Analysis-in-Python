Thunderclouds were gathering in April when James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, went for a run
on the beach on Amelia Island in Florida after attending a closed-door meeting of the bank's top stockbrokers.
After just a few miles, the storm began to pick up speed, prompting Mr. Gorman to turn around and head for
safety.

Mr. Gorman did not get soaked, and his company has become better at avoiding the sort of squalls that have
battered the bank in recent years. Morgan Stanley's stock is up 59 percent this year. Last month, the bank
reported strong third-quarter earnings that reflected the results of Mr. Gorman's three-year effort to reduce
risk-taking and to expand into the safer business of advising people on how to manage their wealth.

''I felt for a long time that path was clear, but it was disputed and we were doubted many times,'' Mr. Gorman said
recently.

Morgan Stanley was known for years for its swagger and its willingness to take big trading risks. Nevertheless, it
was unable to pull back in time in during the financial crisis and sustained significant losses, forcing it to take a $9
billion lifeline in 2008 from a foreign bank. That prompted Mr. Gorman to change course.

The transformation has not been easy, and Mr. Gorman still has some naysayers. Despite the strong third-quarter
results, Morgan Stanley produced a return on equity of just 6.2 percent in the quarter, excluding a charge related
to its credit spreads. Simply to cover its debt expenses and other capital costs, Morgan Stanley must achieve a
return on equity closer to 10 percent. Mr. Gorman said he hoped the bank would hit that number by 2015.

''Last quarter, the stock market was zooming, they did well in divisions like equities, investment banking and
wealth management, and despite it all, it added up to a return on equity of just 6 percent,'' said Glenn Schorr, an
analyst with International Strategy and Investment. ''So yes, they have made a lot of progress, but there is still a
lot of work to be done.''

The bank's fixed-income department continues to be a source of some frustration. This unit, which has posted
some memorable bond-trading losses, has been shedding risky assets and taking fewer gambles. Still, in the first
half of 2013, Glenn Hadden, a prominent interest-rate trader at the bank who has had some successes in the
past, racked up losses of more than $200 million, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the
condition that they not be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record. Mr. Hadden, through
a company spokesman, and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA, says the good news about the new strategy is these kinds of losses are
becoming increasingly rare, and when they do happen, they are ''containable.''

One bright spot for the bank is wealth management, where it has been investing much of its effort. That
department, run by Gregory Fleming, a former Merrill Lynch president, houses the combined brokerage forces of

formed a joint venture with Citigroup. This year, Morgan Stanley bought Citigroup's stake, giving it more than
16,517 brokers worldwide.

Morgan Stanley initially struggled to absorb the unit, and it often had trouble with technology issues. Still, Mr.
Fleming seems to have largely overcome those obstacles. His division posted a pretax profit margin of 19 percent
in the third quarter, ahead of expectations and well ahead of results in the period a year earlier.

Mr. Gorman said that while Morgan Stanley had no immediate plans to add more financial advisers, the company
was putting a greater emphasis on what it offered to its wealthy clients. Brokers who deal with the bank's
wealthiest clients say Mr. Fleming upgraded the trading desk they deal with and is expanding the products sold to
top clients.

Culturally, one of the biggest challenges with the expansion into wealth management was getting Morgan
Stanley's bankers, traders and financial advisers to work together. Bankers are paid to structure mergers, and the
executives they deal with often need financial advisers to manage their money. In theory, banking and retail
brokerage businesses are supposed to complement each other, with one bringing the other business. But on Wall
Street, it rarely works this way, because bankers tend to look down on brokers, whom they see as rather
mundane.

Mr. Fleming has been trying to change this attitude. It doesn't hurt that wealth management, not banking, drives
the company's earnings these days. Wealth management now generates almost 45 percent of Morgan Stanley's
revenue, compared with 23 percent in 2007.

''As a banker, you like wealth management a whole lot more when it is responsible for lifting the entire firm's stock
price at a place where people are paid largely in stock,'' Mr. Mayo said.

Mr. Fleming, a former banker, has moved senior bankers, some of whom he worked with at Merrill Lynch, into
wealth management to work with the company's brokers.

''I recently brought in a possible deal, and someone in banking actually returned my call,'' said one Morgan
Stanley broker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a firm policy against speaking to the media.
''It's harder for the firm's bankers to call us idiots when we are driving the firm's earnings.''

Morgan Stanley's deal to buy the remaining Citigroup stake will also provide the company with billions of dollars in
customer deposits that it plans to use to increase lending to corporations and even individual retail clients. This
will include loans for residential mortgages.

The bank has $82 billion in customer deposits and expects that number to grow to about $138 billion by
mid-2015.

Morgan Stanley can make a lot of money off the spread on these funds -- the difference between what it pays its
customers who own the deposits and what it can lend those deposits for.

Right now, the bank is earning less than 1 percent on these deposits. Mr. Mayo, the CLSA analyst, said Morgan
Stanley's plan could generate an additional $650 million in revenue a year on these deposits, assuming it can
earn a spread of 1.7 percent, which is healthy but still lower than Bank of America's, which is 2.4 percent, he said.
This so-called spread revenue makes up just 13 percent of the wealth management division's revenue, compared
with 34 percent at Bank of America, Mr. Mayo said.

''Morgan Stanley is on the cusp of achieving its greatest benefits in wealth management,'' Mr. Mayo wrote in a
recent report.

Still, lending is not without risk, and this strategy has raised some eyebrows on Wall Street.

''We will be prudent and conservative,'' Mr. Gorman said. ''Our intent is not to be on the leading edge of risk.''

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Its Chief Returns Morgan Stanley to Basics and Profits

Morgan Stanley surprised analysts on Friday with strong third-quarter results that relied on a back-to-basics
approach.

The bank reported a jump in stock-trading revenue and steady growth in its wealth management services. The
results showed that Morgan Stanley's multiyear strategy, under the leadership of James P. Gorman, to move
away from high-risk businesses was beginning to take root.

The news was particularly sweet because it came on the heels of disappointing third-quarter results from Morgan
Stanley's longtime rival Goldman Sachs, rounding out a week of mixed earnings across Wall Street.

Morgan Stanley's share price rose 2.63 percent, or 76 cents, to $29.69, the highest level in more than two and a
half years.

The bank's income from continuing operations, excluding certain charges, was $1 billion, or 50 cents a share, for
the quarter. That beat estimates of 40 cents a share, based on analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

The stronger overall results are in stark contrast to last year, when the bank faced several challenges after
Moody's downgraded the firm's ratings by two notches as part of a larger move to force banks to rein in their
exposure to volatile markets. Under Mr. Gorman's watch as chairman and chief executive, the bank has changed
its focus from risky areas to steadier businesses. This has meant a strong push into wealth management
services.

''In the third quarter the fruit of our strategy was evident,'' Mr. Gorman said in a conference call with analysts.

Excluding one-time items, Morgan Stanley's total revenue came in at an adjusted $8.1 billion in the third quarter,
up from $5.29 billion over the period a year earlier. That also beat analysts' expectations of revenue of $7.6 billion
for the quarter.

Based on generally accepted accounting principles, the company said it had $7.9 billion in revenue and $862
million in profit in the quarter. Last year, the firm's results were dragged down by an accounting charge, which
pushed the firm to a quarterly loss of $1 billion, or 55 cents a share.

Morgan Stanley was the last of the Wall Street banks to report earnings. Like its peers, it has faced a revenue
squeeze as interest rates rose in anticipation that the Federal Reserve was ready to scale back its $85
billion-a-month bond-buying program. Even though the Fed has not yet acted, trading in the bond markets has
been choppy.

On Friday, the bank revealed that solid gains in its equity trading business helped to offset a fall in bond-trading
revenue. It also demonstrated that Mr. Gorman's plan to focus on wealth management was working.

''I think there's good evidence here that Morgan Stanley has turned the corner,'' said Shannon Stemm, a financial
services analyst at Edward Jones. ''It is growing its more stable businesses like wealth management and reducing
risk in the more volatile businesses like fixed income.''

$3.48 billion, slightly higher than the $3.22 billion in the period a year earlier. Its pretax profit margin, a closely
watched number, rose to a record high of 19 percent.

Strong equity markets this year helped to lift the value of assets in Morgan Stanley's portfolio.

Institutional securities, Morgan Stanley's division that includes the company's investment bank and its stock and
bond trading, had revenue of $3.86 billion excluding certain charges, up from $3.74 billion a year earlier.

Revenue from fixed income and commodities, however, was down, as expected. The unit's revenue was $835
million excluding charges, compared with $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Some analysts were expecting the
bank's fixed-income revenue to fall by as much as $500 million in the quarter.

Trading in bonds was weak this quarter as investors held their positions at a time of wider economic uncertainty.

But on Friday, Ruth Porat, the bank's chief financial officer, warned that the prospect of another political impasse
in Washington, which most recently led to a 16-day government shutdown, would weigh on Morgan Stanley's
business in the fourth quarter.

''The biggest headwind for the economy and the markets is Washington,'' she said, adding that ''the process
needs to come to a complete resolution rather than a short patch solution.''

Goldman Banker With Year's Top Tech Quarry

Anthony J. Noto, a former Army Ranger and pro-football executive, may seem an odd fit among the cerebral
recluses and flashy moneymen of the tech world.

Yet Mr. Noto, a 45-year-old Goldman Sachs tech banker, has proved himself a keen observer and trusted banker
of Web pioneers. Now Mr. Noto and Goldman have won the most coveted tech banking assignment this year in
leading the initial public offering of Twitter.

It is a sweet victory given that its archrival in tech I.P.O.'s, Morgan Stanley, has led the market debuts in
Facebook, LinkedIn and Kayak, among others.

The problems with the Facebook offering last year -- first-day trading troubles and an early slide in the stock price
-- took some of the luster off Morgan Stanley, and its star tech banker, Michael Grimes, possibly to Goldman's
benefit. (Morgan Stanley, however, has been the lead underwriter on eight of the 10 biggest tech I.P.O.'s since
Facebook.)

Still, there are contrasts between Mr. Noto and Mr. Grimes, a charismatic gadget lover who lives in Silicon Valley,
while Mr. Noto has chosen to remain in New York and avoid much of the Silicon Valley scene.

Mr. Noto forged a number of relationships during the first Internet boom, when he was an analyst with Goldman.
One was with ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce company based in North Carolina.

A decade later, Mr. Noto returned to North Carolina as a Goldman banker to help take the company public -- an
assignment that was won with his first pitch.

''He's kind of like the Don Draper of I.P.O.'s,'' Scot Wingo, the chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, said about Mr.
Noto. ''Part of a good I.P.O. pitch is confidence, and succinctness, and when he says those words there's a
certain amount of gravitas. As a nerdy computer guy, I respect that.''

A football fan from an early age, Mr. Noto was starting as quarterback for the high school team while he was still
in middle school. He chose to attend West Point not because he wanted to join the military, but because he
longed to be a leader. Nonetheless, he went on to serve as a member of the elite Rangers.

Upon leaving the Army, he worked as a brand manager for Kraft Foods, then received a master's of business
degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After a brief turn at Lehman Brothers, Mr.
Noto joined Goldman in 1999.

As a young analyst, he wrote glowing reports about some of the biggest flops of the Internet bubble, including
Webvan and eToys. Investors who took his advice lost small fortunes. After some of those misses, colleagues
within Goldman took to calling him Anthony ''No-Dough.'' CNBC, meanwhile, called him Anthony ''Don't Know.''

But Mr. Noto persevered, continuing to recommend tech stocks even after Silicon Valley had been humbled. His
judgment improved, and he was named the best Internet analyst by Institutional Investor magazine for several
years in a row.

Page5of201©2014Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.''I honestly think I'm the kind of person that is driven by fear of failure rather than striving for success,'' Mr. Noto
told Wharton magazine in 2009. ''I tend to go to bed scared and wake up terrified.''

By 2004 Mr. Noto had made partner at Goldman, a rapid ascent, especially given his early misses. He left to
become chief financial officer of the National Football League, returning to Goldman to help lead the bank's tech
and media group just before a potential league lockout.

It was an audacious move, and some questioned whether he would be able to fit in with a technology industry that
had come a long way since the dot-com bubble. Mr. Noto, a standout linebacker in college, does not possess the
sort of big personality that might have made him a natural fit among the outsize egos of Silicon Valley's traditional
bankers.

''I know more about his family than the kind of car he drives,'' Mr. Wingo of ChannelAdvisor said. ''He's not a
flashy guy.''

But over the last three years, Mr. Noto's understated approach has begun to pay off. Goldman's share of the
technology I.P.O. market, erratic in the years after the crisis, has been more consistent of late. This year, the firm
has led the successful public offerings of a number of tech companies, including Marketo, Tableau Software and
Silver Spring Networks, placing it atop the league tables for the year to date.

Now Mr. Noto faces his biggest test yet. In managing the Twitter offering, he will be bringing a ubiquitous but
financially unproved social network to the public markets. In doing so, Mr. Noto and his team at Goldman must
account for valuation expectations, the cash needs of Twitter and investor appetite for shares.

When Twitter began preparing to go public early this year, it interviewed a number of banks. Twitter's chief
executive, Dick Costolo, and its chief financial officer, Ali Rowghani, developed a strong rapport with Mr. Noto.
Like Mr. Noto, the senior Twitter executives are operational types who prefer to fly under the radar. Helping
matters further was the fact that Mr. Noto and Mr. Rowghani are both big fans of the Dallas Cowboys.

By April, Twitter had selected Goldman as lead underwriter, guaranteeing it a hefty fee and a large allocation of
shares. Rounding out Twitter's syndicate are Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Bank of
America. Two boutiques, Allen & Company and Code Advisors, are providing Twitter with advice.

Also working in Goldman's favor was the perception, inside Twitter, that the bank understood the company.
Goldman features a Twitter widget on the company intranet, uses the service on its trading platform, and even
advertises with Twitter.

Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference this year, Mr. Noto emphasized the importance of an investment
bank's role in helping a company draft its S-1 document, which Twitter filed late on Thursday. ''You're really
solidifying, for the entire investment community, the foundation of how to think about the company,'' he said.

Mr. Noto and his Goldman colleagues declined to comment. But others who know Mr. Noto say he is well suited
for the job.

''I've known Anthony since 1997 and have always greatly respected him,'' Spencer Rascoff, the chief executive of
real estate Web site Zillow, said in an e-mail. ''He is a trusted adviser to leading technology executives because
he is a humble whip-smart straight-shooter.''

Since returning to technology after his time at the N.F.L., Mr. Noto has enmeshed himself in new technology. He
is a regular user of Twitter, sending out public messages about football, venture capital and Internet companies.

On Quora, the question and answer Web site, he asked, ''Is there a mismatch between private and public
valuations for Internet companies?''

Morgan Stanley Announces a Buyback, and Its Shares Rise

Morgan Stanley shares rose more than 4 percent on Thursday after the firm announced it planned to buy back a
chunk of its own stock.

News that the firm had received approval from the Federal Reserve to repurchase $500 million worth of its stock
was good for shareholders, whose stake in the company has been diluted in recent years as the firm issued
millions of shares to pay employees. This dilution has weighed on the stock, and it was trading in the teens earlier
this year.

The stock rose about 4.4 percent, or $1.16, to close at $27.70, a level it has not hit since 2011. It is the first
buyback Morgan Stanley has undertaken since the financial crisis and comes after the firm's decision to buy the
remaining stake of its wealth management business, a move James P. Gorman, the firm's chairman and chief
executive, has heralded as ''transformational.''

Morgan Stanley received approval from regulators in June to buy the rest of its wealth management division, a
joint venture it formed with Citigroup during the crisis. Since then, the firm has been working to diversify its
earnings, moving away from riskier businesses like trading and into wealth management, which offers steady,
albeit lower returns. Its ability to purchase all of that division gave it full control of the operation and the full share
of the profits.

Mr. Gorman told analysts that the firm was careful to have the wealth management purchase in order -- and paid
for -- before it started spending money on stock buybacks.

The other good news for shareholders was the firm's second-quarter earnings, which came in slightly ahead of
analysts' expectations.

The firm reported that second-quarter profit applicable to Morgan Stanley's common shareholders rose 42
percent, to $802 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $564 million, or 29 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. Overall net income was $980 million, compared with $591 million in the period a year earlier.

The results, however, were affected by two big charges, one related to Morgan Stanley's credit spreads and the
other to its recent purchase of the remaining stake of the wealth management business. Stripping out those
charges, the firm had a profit of $872 million, or 45 cents a share. That beat the estimates of analysts polled by
Thomson Reuters, which had projected a profit of 43 cents a share.

Morgan Stanley's revenue, excluding those charges, rose to $8.3 billion in the second quarter from $6.6 billion in
the period a year earlier.

The results were driven by decent performances in most of its business units, notably wealth management and
equity and debt trading. Morgan Stanley is coming off what was a weak second quarter of 2012 and is also
enjoying what seems to be a better operating environment for all banks.

Morgan Stanley is the last big financial institution to report second-quarter earnings, and results have been
generally strong as lenders seem to be benefiting from a pickup in the American economy. Goldman Sachs, for
instance, reported that its net income doubled, beating analysts' expectations handily.

Page7of201©2014Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.At Morgan Stanley, wealth management, which is led by Gregory J. Fleming, was a big focus for analysts on the
quarterly conference call.

That unit, with 16,321 financial advisers, posted net revenue of $3.5 billion, up more than 10 percent. Its pretax
profit margin, a widely watched figure on Wall Street, came in at 18.5 percent. That margin, which previously had
been around 17 percent, was higher than the firm's expectations.

Institutional securities, which houses Morgan Stanley's banking and trading operations, posted net revenue,
excluding the debt charge, of about $4.2 billion, up about 40 percent from a year earlier.

The firm experienced a solid increase in revenue from various segments in this department, including debt and
equity underwriting, investment banking, and currency and commodities trading.

The fixed-income sales and trading unit reported that adjusted revenue rose to $1.2 billion from $771 million in
the period a year earlier. This year's performance was slightly below what analysts were hoping for.

In the second quarter, there was a sudden and sharp rise in interest rates after the Federal Reserve indicated it
might wind down its bond purchase program, which has helped the economy recover from the financial crisis.

Ruth Porat, the bank's chief financial officer, told analysts that the firm reduced the risk it was taking trading
interest rate products.

While the bank's second-quarter results were a marked improvement over those in the period a year earlier, the
firm is still producing a return on equity, excluding the two charges, of just 5.6 percent. This is up from 2.1 percent
in the period a year earlier but still well below what it costs the bank to simply cover its debt expenses and other
capital costs. To do that, it needs to achieve a return on equity, an important measure of profitability, of closer to
10 percent.

Morgan Stanley To Buy Citi Stake In Joint Venture

Morgan Stanley plans this month to buy the remaining stake in the wealth management joint venture it formed
with Citigroup in the depths of the financial crisis.

The firm said on Friday that it had received regulatory approval to purchase the remaining 35 percent stake in the
Morgan StanleySmith Barney joint venture it did not own for a previously established price of $4.7 billion, which
will be paid to Citigroup in cash.

The joint venture was born in 2009, forged from Citigroup's Smith Barney unit and Morgan Stanley's counterpart.
Citigroup had long identified the brokerage business as a nonessential asset to be sold to free up capital during a
difficult time for the bank. For Morgan Stanley, the deal offered controlling interest in the venture and an
expanded presence in wealth management as it sought to diversify away from certain trading businesses and into
less risky ones, like selling stocks and bonds to retail investors.

''It has been a long journey,'' said James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive, who was
visiting family in Australia when he received word of the approval. ''It's nice to see something go from vision to see
something actually happen.''

The firm had been waiting for months for the government to grant approval to buy the remaining stake, and the
development is an important one for Morgan Stanley, which has made a big bet on wealth management. It
expects the deal to close at the end of the month, according to a release on Friday.

Morgan Stanley said it would log a negative adjustment to its capital of about $200 million, reflecting the
difference between the purchase price and the brokerage's carrying value, which will hurt the company's
second-quarter earnings, scheduled to be released in July.

Glenn Schorr, an analyst who covers Morgan Stanley for Nomura, said that while the announcement had been
expected, it was symbolic for Morgan Stanley and meant the firm would no longer have to hand over part of the
earnings of the business to Citigroup. Mr. Gorman said there were smaller benefits, too. For instance, Morgan
Stanley will now control things like trading flow, which were previously shared with Citigroup.

Wealth management can be an attractive business. It requires relatively little capital to operate and brokers tend
to generate a steady stream of commissions. It accounts for 42 percent of Morgan Stanley's revenue, up from just
25 percent in the first quarter of 2008, when earnings were powered by trading operations. The unit, which is led
by Gregory Fleming of Morgan Stanley, has been preforming above expectations.

The business has about 17,000 wealth advisers and $1.8 trillion in assets under management. In the most recent
quarter, the unit reported revenue of $3.47 billion, up from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier.

Still, the strategy is not without some risk. Wall Street's most productive brokers are constantly being poached by
rival firms or setting up shop on their own. And when these employees leave, they often take their clients. In
addition, rising interest rates are likely to dent mortgage origination, an area Morgan Stanley is pushing into. At
the same time, though, rising rates will allow Morgan Stanley to generate more income on customer deposits.
