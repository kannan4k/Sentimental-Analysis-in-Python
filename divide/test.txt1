CHP report urges the charge in the fatal fall of passenger from party bus last

year.

The California Highway Patrol has recommended a murder charge be filed against

the owner of a "party bus" after a 24-year-old man fell out of it and died on

the 101 Freeway last year in Studio City.



The CHP submitted its traffic collision report for review last week in the

incident in which Christopher "C.J." Saraceno II lost his balance and fell down

the steps of the 2001 Ford F-550.



The L.A. County district attorney's office is considering filing criminal

charges against Ayrapet Kasabyan, president of Hyros Corp., which operates

Platinum Style Limousine Service.



The investigation found the vehicle had several mechanical violations and had

been barred from service "for the safety of passengers."



"Mr. Kasabyan continued to use this vehicle for profit (51 times), exhibiting a

malignant heart until the untimely death of the victim," the report said.



Authorities found that when Saraceno's body struck the door, it unexpectedly

opened, causing him to fall to his death on the southbound 101 Freeway just

north of Universal Studios Boulevard.



More than two dozen passengers were on board for a birthday party and some told

officers the bus had jerked before Saraceno fell. At least two people attempted

to save him.



Brothers Brandon, 26, and Justin Janssen, 23, both of Milford, Mich., described

grabbing his hands and shirt but having to let go for fear they, too, would be

pulled under the moving bus.



CHP officers said Saraceno was struck by other vehicles after he fell from the

bus.



CHP commercial investigators inspected the bus after the fatal accident and

determined the passenger door was not functioning properly and that Saraceno

died after being run over by the bus' rear tires.



Darren Kavinoky, attorney for Kasabyan, could not be reached for comment. In an

interview with investigators, Kasabyan said no driver had reported the door as

not working properly.



He told investigators that perhaps someone inside the bus had pulled the

"emergency release" to open the door and pushed Saraceno out, then closed it

before alerting the driver.



That angered Saraceno's friends.



"The idea that he can make that statement without any evidence is infuriating

because he's trying to cover his own butt," said William Wawro, Saraceno's

friend and former roommate. "It shows you the character of the head of the

company."



Michael Kelley, head of CHP's motor carrier safety unit, said the company was

rated unsatisfactory in its last safety inspection, finished late last month.



Bus operators in California are required to undergo an annual inspection by a

CHP commercial enforcement officer. The inspections are a condition of licensing

by the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates all passenger

carriers in the state.



The Sept. 29 death was the second fatality in the state that authorities say was

the result of poor vehicle maintenance by the owner of a party bus company. Last

May, authorities arrested bus operator Jon Reno St. James in connection with the

death of Natasha Noland, 25. The Santa Cruz resident died when she and another

woman fell from a party bus in Los Gatos in 2012.



A grand jury alleged St. James was negligent in the maintenance of the company's

buses. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and vehicular manslaughter.



Saraceno's parents have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Kasabyan and the

bus driver. They are seeking unspecified damages and burial costs.



Saraceno earned a bachelor's degree from Tufts University near Boston. He moved

from his home in Watertown, Conn., to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film and

media.



"He always made me proud, so proud. I would tell him all the time," said his

mother, Rita Saraceno. "He packed up his little Honda Civic and drove across the

country to make a go of what he had done."
