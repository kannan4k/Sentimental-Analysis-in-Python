DETROIT -- General Motors will pay the first quarterly dividend on its common stock in almost six years, another
step in the American automaker's recovery from its bankruptcy.

The carmaker, the largest in the United States, said on Tuesday it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of
30 cents a share, payable on March 28 to shareholders of record on March 18. It last paid a quarterly dividend in
June 2008, before it moved to save money during the recession, of 25 cents a share.

''This return to shareholders is consistent with our capital priorities and is an important signal of confidence in our
plans for a continuing profitable future,'' G.M.'s chief financial officer, Daniel Ammann, said.

Mr. Ammann will become G.M.'s president on Wednesday. G.M. also named Chuck Stevens as the company's
new chief financial officer, effective Wednesday. He had been chief financial officer of G.M. North America.

The dividend announcement sent shares up more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Investors have been
pushing G.M. to return cash to them in the form of a dividend or a stock buyback, especially since the Treasury
sold the last of its stake in the company last month.

The dividend reintroduction by G.M., which is showing new cars and trucks this week at the Detroit auto show, is
likely to attract investors who buy stocks that generate income.

Weak industry demand drove G.M. to seek bankruptcy protection in 2009 and it emerged as a leaner operation
with more cash on hand with the help of a $49.5 billion taxpayer bailout.

G.M. already pays a dividend on preferred stock.

Its rival Ford Motor resumed paying a common dividend in March 2012 after suspending it for more than five
years. Last week, Ford increased its quarterly dividend by 25 percent, to 12.5 cents a share.

G.M. ended the third quarter last year with total automotive liquidity of $37.3 billion.

A Coupe for Cadillac's BMW-Battling Line

Introduced on Tuesday, Jan. 14: 2015 Cadillac ATS coupe

What is it? A two-door compact car to complement the ATS sedan introduced as a 2013 model. This helps to fill
out the ATS line, potentially making it more competitive with upscale European compacts from BMW,
Mercedes-Benz and Audi, which all offer coupes and sedans.

Is it real? As real as its sedan sibling. The ATS Coupe is scheduled to arrive at dealerships this summer.

What they said: ''The Cadillac ATS sports sedan was a tipping point,'' Robert Ferguson, General Motors' senior
vice president for Cadillac, said at the media presentation of the new model. Already the ATS has won the hearts
of a new audience, he said, adding that 17 percent of buyers were first-time Cadillac customers and that after the
ATS's introduction the number of Cadillac customers under 35 doubled. ''With ATS attracting new customers, the
coupe is a logical next step,'' he said. In a media release, Cadillac said that while the coupe and sedan were of a
family, they shared few body parts; the roof, doors, rear fenders and trunk lid are unique to the coupe. The two
models are built on a 109.3-inch wheelbase, but the coupe's track -- the distance between the opposing wheels --
is wider.

What they didn't say: While Cadillac met its sales objectives with the ATS sedan, the transaction price has lagged
that of the BMW 3 Series. An expanded lineup could help in that regard. And while there are rumors that a
high-performance ATS-V is on the way, G.M. did not confirm that.

What makes it tick: Two of the engines available in the ATS Sedan are offered in the coupe: a standard 2-liter
turbocharged 4-cylinder making 272 horsepower and an optional 3.6-liter V6 rated at 321 horsepower. Cadillac
said the 4-cylinder was ''one of the most power-dense engines in the industry, topping engines from European
competitors.'' Both engines are equipped with direct fuel injection and dual overhead camshafts with continuously
variable valve timing. The sedan's base engine, a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter 4, will not be available in the coupe.
A 6-speed automatic is offered with either engine, and a 6-speed manual is available with the 2-liter. A variety of
electronic crash-avoidance features are optional at extra cost.

How much, how soon: The 2015 ATS coupe is scheduled to arrive at dealerships this summer. Prices have not
been announced.

How's it look: At a glance, the car has more in common with the 2014 CTS coupe than with its sedan sibling. The
character lines in the sheet metal appear to be identical to those of the CTS, but the ATS coupe's front fascia is
sleeker and cleaner. It also gets a new badge in place of the traditional crest and wreath -- basically, a more
geometric version of the crest, without the wreath. More science, less art.

Feeling Steadier, Ford Remakes F-150 Pickup, the Nation's No. 1 Vehicle

DETROIT -- The heady combination of growing sales and big profits has spurred automakers to reinvest heavily
in new models and make major changes to some of their most prominent vehicles.

No company has stretched further than Ford Motor, the second-largest American automaker after General Motors,
which on Monday took the wraps off a radically redesigned pickup truck at the annual Detroit auto show.

Instead of playing it safe with its best-selling F-150 truck, Ford will replace its traditional steel body panels with
aluminum parts, which saves weight and improves fuel economy.

Such a wholesale change would have been unheard-of a few years ago, when Ford and other carmakers were
under intense pressure to cut costs and save money.

But now Ford has invested heavily to significantly make over the truck, even though it finished 2013 as the
nation's top-selling vehicle of any kind for the 32nd consecutive year.

''It's all about maintaining leadership,'' said Alan R. Mulally, Ford's chief executive. ''We don't take risks we can't
deliver on.''

Ford is hardly alone in its efforts to significantly upgrade high-volume products and seek to gain an edge in a
competitive marketplace.

The aggressive approach is made possible, in part, by drastic improvements in the financial conditions of the
Detroit carmakers and their foreign rivals.

Ford, like their hometown competitors General Motors and Chrysler, has transferred costly retiree health care
obligations to employee trusts.

The companies have also reduced the number of workers and factories to better align production with market
demand.

In addition to cutting costs, the companies are enjoying the fruits of a steadily expanding market for new vehicles
in the United States, as well as higher sticker prices for new models.

Industry analysts said the companies are intent on building on their recent success with better products loaded
with new technology and features

''These turnarounds always take place because of new product,'' said Michelle Krebs, an independent auto
analyst in Detroit. ''In this case, Ford is rolling the dice on the aluminum truck to improve what is already a
dominant position.''

Chrysler, the smallest of the three Detroit car companies, is also pushing hard to capture a bigger chunk of the
American market, which last year grew by 7.6 percent, to 15.6 million vehicles.

The company has methodically revamped several of its most important models since it was forced to seek a
government bailout and file for bankruptcy five years ago.

Page3of193©2014Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.On Monday, it showed off a new version of its Chrysler 200 midsize sedan -- which has lagged the company's
overall growth in the United States.

''We needed a credible competitor in the midsize market,'' said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler
and its Italian parent company, Fiat.

Chrysler spent more than $1 billion to overhaul an assembly plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., to produce the new
model, which features a fuel-saving nine-speed transmission and a sleek new body style.

Since its bankruptcy and bailout, Chrysler has focused mainly on improving its most successful models, like the
Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickup truck.

But Mr. Marchionne said that Chrysler was now financially healthy enough to expend resources on products that,
in the past, might have been neglected.

''Do we have the resources to do whatever we want to do?'' he said. ''The answer is yes.''

General Motors, the biggest American automaker, is also revving up product programs that were delayed or
hampered by its bankruptcy and bailout in 2009.

The company is showing off variations on two hot models, the Chevrolet Corvette sports car and Cadillac ATS
sedan, at the Detroit show.

G.M. also revealed a redesigned version of its GMC midsize pickup -- a niche vehicle that it could not afford to
update when the company was under financial stress.

''We might not have done this before,'' said Mark Reuss, who this week takes over as G.M.'s global product chief.
''But we see a lot of open space in the market where we can make gains with a midsize pickup.''

Other automakers are also loading up with new models being introduced in Detroit, like a new version of the Fit
subcompact from Honda.

The star of the show so far, however, has been the Ford pickup.

Analysts and executives from competing automakers have expressed mixed views on Ford's bold strategy to trim
700 pounds of weight in the F-150 with aluminum parts.

The question asked repeatedly was why would Ford risk such a broad change of a perennially popular vehicle?

''We couldn't be happier about our recent success, but we cannot afford to be complacent for one second,'' said
William C. Ford Jr., Ford's executive chairman.

Redesigning the truck and updating factories to produce it could cost Ford more than $2 billion, according to
estimates by analysts, an enormous commitment, even for the capital-intensive auto industry.

''This is a huge deal,'' said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. ''It's a
game-changer for Ford in so many ways.''

But Ford has made several large bets on new technology under the leadership of Mr. Mulally, who said recently
that he would remain at the automaker at least through this year rather than continue to be considered as a chief
executive candidate at the software giant Microsoft.

''We had one of our most fantastic years ever in 2013, but we cannot back off,'' he said. ''You have to take
chances if you want to stay the leader.''

Ford's revamped F-150 is 700 pounds lighter for better fuel economy. Alan R. Mulally, in the center left, Ford's
chief, said the carmaker had a great 2013, but added: ''It's all about maintaining leadership. We don't take risks
we can't deliver on.'' (PHOTOGRAPHS BY JOSHUA LOTT/REUTERS; TANNEN MAURY/EUROPEAN PRESS

General Motors kicked off the 2014 North American International Auto Show in style Monday, sweeping the
awards for the North American Car and Truck of the year with its new Chevrolet Corvette Stingray sports car and
Silverado pickup.

The awards have been given out annually since 1994 at the opening of the Detroit auto show. They are selected
by a panel of automotive journalists from the United States and Canada. This year, the list of eligible vehicles
included 28 cars and 18 truck and utility wagons.

Corvette's victory represents the sixth time a G.M. model has won the North American Car of the Year Award.
Corvette previously won the award in 1998.

It was also the fourth time a G.M. pickup won the North American Truck/Utility of the Year Award. The 2014
models were the subject of a recall last week. Silverado was also a winner in 2007.

The finalists were the Cadillac CTS, Chevrolet Corvette Stingray and Mazda3 for the 2014 North American Car of
the Year. The Acura MDX, Silverado and Jeep Cherokee the finalists for the 2014 North American Truck/Utility of
the Year.

General Motors said it was recalling about 370,0000 of its redesigned full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC
Sierra pickups to reprogram software that could cause parts of the exhaust to overheat. G.M. said eight fires had
been caused by the problem, but there were no injuries. It urged customers to avoid leaving trucks idling
unattended. The recall included 2014 model trucks with 4.3-liter and 5.3-liter engines in the United States,
Canada, Mexico and other markets. Trucks with 6.2-liter engines were not being recalled.

Fiat's Challenge Is to Improve Performance in Italy and Asia

PARIS -- The Fiat boss, Sergio Marchionne, has finally won complete ownership of Chrysler and can begin trying
to realize his dream of building a world-class carmaker to compete with the industry leaders Toyota, General
Motors and Volkswagen. At the top of the to-do list: Stanch the deterioration in Fiat's home market and fix a
glaring hole in its Asia business.

Mr. Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, rescued the Detroit automaker from bankruptcy in a
2009 deal with the Obama administration that gave Fiat 58.5 percent of Chrysler and the potential to raise that
stake. In an agreement announced on Wednesday, the companies said that Fiat would buy the remaining 41.5
percent from a United Automobile Workers health care trust for $4.35 billion. The deal creates a company that
last year had $114 billion in sales, making it the world's seventh-largest automaker.

Mr. Marchionne has long held that to be competitive and profitable in the global auto market, a carmaker needs to
sell at least six million vehicles annually. The Chrysler-Fiat alliance, which sold about 4.5 million vehicles last
year, remains short of that target.

The agreement capped months of thorny negotiations and opens the way to a possible New York listing of
Fiat-Chrysler shares. It also smooths the way for a relaunch of the Alfa Romeo brand in the United States.

''It's a deal that Fiat had to get done,'' Harald Hendrikse, an analyst at Nomura in London, said. ''As usual, Mr.
Marchionne's pulled a rabbit out of the hat.''

Investors welcomed the news. Fiat's shares soared 16 percent Thursday on the Milan bourse.

To lift sales, Mr. Marchionne must look to emerging markets, analysts said.

Fiat already has a good presence in Brazil, enjoying a healthy 23 percent of the market, though that share is
under threat from aggressive entrants like Toyota and Hyundai.

But it has only a minimal presence in China, the world's biggest car market. Massimo Vecchio, an analyst at
Mediobanca in Milan, said the only hope of reaching Mr. Marchionne's goal of six million vehicles was through a
partnership with an Asian automaker that would allow it to gain access to the Chinese car market, the world's
biggest.

''Fiat is late to the game in Asia,'' Mr. Vecchio said. ''That's the only way they'll be able to recover the lost ground.''
He suggested the Japanese automakers Mazda and Suzuki as possible partners.

While Chrysler is doing well in the United States, with sales rising 9.3 percent last year, Fiat is faltering in Europe.
Its European sales -- which include its own brand, as well as Lancia, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo and Jeep cars -- fell
7.8 percent in the 11 months through November from the same period in 2012. That's far worse than the 2.7
percent decline in the overall European market.

In that time, the company's market share slipped to 5.8 percent from 6.2 percent. But the picture is even worse
than it first appears, Mr. Hendrikse said. The company is overly reliant on Italy, which accounts for about a third of
Fiat's sales. Excluding the Italian market, he said, Fiat's European market share is only about 2 percent.

Page7of193©2014Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.''The Fiat brand at this stage is no longer a relevant competitor in the European space,'' Mr. Hendrikse said. The
company, he added, is ''horrendously undercapitalized and badly positioned. I don't see how Chrysler is going to
help them much in Europe.''

When the deal was first struck back in 2009, Fiat played the white knight to Chrysler, providing the American
company with leadership and technology at a moment of crisis. Chrysler's Dodge Dart, for example, is built on a
modified Alfa Romeo platform.

But now the roles are reversed. Chrysler has been providing virtually all of Fiat's profit for the last three quarters,
and with Europe's car market expected to grow only about 3 percent this year, that is unlikely to change soon.

Mr. Vecchio said that Fiat was trying to move upmarket in Europe, where profit margins are higher than in the
mass market. But the company's combined debt of about 10 billion euros could hamper investment. Still, analysts
are cautious about underestimating Mr. Marchionne, especially before an April update when the company is set to
present a new business plan.

''The unified ownership structure will now allow us to fully execute our vision of creating a global automaker that is
truly unique,'' Mr. Marchionne said in a statement on Wednesday.

In the deal, Chrysler will pay a special $1.9 billion dividend to the United Automobile Workers' retiree health care
fund, and pay out an additional $700 million in four installments after the deal closes, as soon as this month. Fiat
is planning to pay its contribution, $1.75 billion, without tapping the market for new cash.

At about $4.35 billion, then, Mr. Marchionne is getting Chrysler for a small fraction of the $36 billion that Daimler,
the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, paid for it in 1998. Daimler, the German company later came to regret that
investment, essentially handing it to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007 to cut its losses.

Still, Mr. Marchionne faces an uphill climb, as he looks to build the build into a top player in the auto industry.

''What was true in 2009 remains true today,'' Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at IHS Automotive, wrote in a research
note. ''Fiat and Chrysler independently were both weaker, smaller players. Combining two weak companies may
not result in one strong company, even with the opportunities for better efficiencies of scale, plant utilization and
purchasing power.''

It was the year when Fisker fizzled and Coda collapsed, along with the dreams of several other would-be
automakers. Tesla provided endless drama as its chief executive, Elon Musk, swatted at naysayers, state dealer
associations and federal regulators, even as the Model S became a trophy car for the affluent and tech-savvy.

Among higher-volume companies, General Motors seemed to find its stride again with several well-received new
models. Ford's luxury division declared itself the Lincoln Motor Company and attempted a much-needed
makeover -- so far, mostly by smearing cosmetics on Fords.

Toyota and Nissan reworked their high-volume compacts, the Corolla and Sentra, but both seemed stodgy in
relation to the competition, particularly from Mazda.

Among the Germans, BMW continued to spin out a dizzying array of spinoffs from its basic models: hatchback
GTs, four-door Gran Coupes and a new 4 Series line. Mercedes looked for sales high, with a new flagship sedan,
and low, with the $30,000 CLA aimed at 30-somethings. Volkswagen, bereft of new products, sent its top
American executive packing as sales slid.

And a bit unexpectedly, the best new models included many stellar sports cars, perhaps signaling that good times
are about to roll -- or, at least that wealthy buyers are ready to splurge on pretty toys.

Over all, it was a good year for car buyers, as postrecession investments paid off, bringing interesting models to
showrooms.

As in past years, writers for Automobiles have each picked the cars and trucks that have stood out. The Mazda 3
topped both lists, and while in the past the writers have included some of the same vehicles, this year they agreed
on eight of the 12 models.

and low, with the $30,000 CLA aimed at 30-somethings. Volkswagen, bereft of new products, sent its top
American executive packing as sales slid.

Over all, it was a good year for car buyers, as postrecession investments paid off, bringing interesting models to
showrooms. Here are a dozen that stood out:

1. MAZDA 3 ($17,740 base; $24,785 as tested) In a compact class full of competent -- sometimes exemplary --
cars, the eager-to-please 3 is the class act, and it seems to belong, like a 14-year-old prodigy who skips high
school to start college, in a whole other category. From its fine road manners to its responsive yet efficient
powertrains, from its Alfa-sleek exterior to its controls and driving position, everything about the 3 just feels right.

2. CHEVROLET CORVETTE STINGRAY ($51,995 base; $71,960) I never felt the urge to get my accelerator
ankle tattooed with Corvette's crossed-flag logo; I tend to prefer sports cars that are lean, light and high-revving.
But the latest, greatest generation of the 'Vette is just too good, on too many levels, to ignore. America's Sports
Car has long been a bargain. This one can frolic with bona fide exotics at a fraction of their cost, yet is also a
delightful companion for everyday driving.

3. CADILLAC CTS ($46,025 base; $60,095 for Vsport as tested) If you're a taxpayer still fuming over your
temporary investment in General Motors, take heart: Not only is ownership of G.M. back in the private sector, but
your contribution helped to create one of the world's finest luxury sport sedans. The 2014 CTS isn't just another
big leap for Cadillac; its spirit is distinctly American, and it's every bit as good as its haughty German rivals.

4. JAGUAR F-TYPE ($69,985 base; $98,395 for V8 S as tested) That style! That growl! That thrust! The first
two-seat Jag since the E-Type isn't perfect -- it's a bit too heavy and quite a lot too expensive, for starters -- but
it's the perfect car for exploring mountain roads on a lovely fall day. In the Catskills, the lovely F-Type was
constant camera bait, and it drew a crowd of admirers at every stop.

5. CHEVROLET IMPALA ($27,535 base; $39,510) In the 1960s, the Impala name -- applied to millions of widely
varied but always stylish models -- really meant something. In recent years, it meant something else entirely:
boring fleet cars. The 2014 Impala is a huge step up with expressive styling and a quiet, comfortable ride.

Page10of193©2014Factiva,Inc.Allrightsreserved.6. MAZDA 6 ($21,675 base; $29,495) Like the winsome 3 and the impressive CX-5 cute-ute, Mazda's redesigned
family sedan has found the sweet spot in a crowded market. With spirited performance, 30 m.p.g. economy and
impressive road manners, the spacious 6 is the life of the midsize party.

7. MERCEDES-BENZ S550 ($93,825 base; $113,815) After absorbing a detailed presentation about all the sci-fi
wizardry in the 2014 S-Class, I slid into the driver's seat with trepidation. Who wants to share the wheel with
computerized drivers-in-waiting? Do you need an engineering degree to drive this thing? Happily, the big
luxo-cruiser keeps its autonomous helpers mostly on the down low, and the ride is as soothing as it should be at
this price. Once again, there's no car I'd rather drive in a hurry from coast to coast.

8. HYUNDAI SANTA FE ($25,555 for base Sport; $38,730 as tested) One of the year's nicest surprises, and one
of the more impressive crossovers at any price, the Santa Fe shows a level of attention to thoughtful details -- an
impressive list of standard features; convenient charge ports, storage trays and cup holders; seamless Bluetooth
integration -- that continues to escape larger competitors.

9. LEXUS IS 350 ($40,375 base; $49,615 for F-Sport as tested) At Café Lexus, where warm milk is always on the
menu, the aggressively redesigned 2014 IS 350 is a triple-espresso alternative with overcaffeinated performance
and a hip interior. Now, if only we could convince Lexus that joysticks belong on video game consoles, not
controlling in-car infotainment systems.

10. RANGE ROVER SUPERCHARGED ($99,100 base; $133,695) Equally at home in East Hampton,
backcountry Greenwich and on TriBeCa's elite streets, the Range Rover is practically a cliché: a Country Squire
for 21st century Gordon Gekkos. The latest version, though, is a revelation: How did they get such a big, tall box
to feel so buttoned-down and carlike?

11. KIA CADENZA ($35,000 base; $41,900) I was there in the mid-1990s when an obscure Korean company
showed up with a pair of neo-agricultural vehicles and cheeky TV ads, and I didn't see this coming: Not only has
Kia thrived, it has become a leader in style, value and customer-friendly design. And this year the Korean
company rolled out a genuinely pleasant upscale sedan that can brush $42,000 and yet seem like a reasonable
value.

12. CHEVROLET CRUZE DIESEL ($25,695 base; $25,795) America's highest-mileage nonhybrid car with an
internal-combustion engine, the Cruze Diesel impresses with its 46 m.p.g. highway rating -- I got 50-plus on some
stretches -- 720-mile range and copious torque for jack-rabbit starts. Like the terrific new diesels from other
automakers -- VW's diesel sales will top 100,000 this year -- the Cruze makes a strong argument that Americans
should give oil burners another look.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

General Motors' joint venture in China is recalling 1.46 million cars because of a defect with the fuel pump
brackets, in one of the largest safety recalls in the world's biggest auto market. The cars are made locally by
Shanghai General Motors, G.M.'s venture with SAIC Motor. G.M. said that the bracket might crack after long-term
use, and in extreme cases that could lead to fuel leaks. The recall affects two of G.M.'s most popular models in

DETROIT -- After a year of big profits and surging sales in the United States, the American automakers are
investing heavily in their domestic operations in anticipation of more good times to come.

General Motors, the nation's largest auto company, said Monday it would spend about $1.3 billion to upgrade five
factories in the Midwest, including a major overhaul of one of its highly profitable truck plants.

The news followed Ford Motor's announcement last week that it was hiring 5,000 new workers next year and
introducing 16 new vehicles in North America.

The investments show confidence in the continued growth in 2014 of the automotive sector -- one of the
economy's bright spots this year.

''Today's announced plant upgrades continue the momentum of a resurgent auto industry,'' Mark Reuss, head of
G.M.'s North American division, said on Monday at the company's pickup truck plant in Flint, Mich.

G.M. said it would invest $600 million in the Flint facility, including building a new paint shop that would make its
trucks more competitive in the expanding pickup segment.

The company is also spending $493 million at another Michigan factory to produce a new transmission that
increases fuel economy and to expand capacity for a high-tech V-6 engine. The rest of the new spending will be
at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.

G.M. said the investments would create or preserve about 1,000 manufacturing jobs, and position the company to
take advantage of more growth in the critical American market.

''Today's announcement is a win for American workers,'' said Joe Ashton, an official of the United Auto Workers,
which represents 7,500 employees at the five affected plants.

The new investments are being made after the strong performance of the American auto market this year.
Manufacturers sold 14.24 million new cars and trucks through November, an 8.4 percent rise from a year ago.

The industry is on pace for its best annual sales since 2007. And analysts are predicting that the year could close
out with exceptionally healthy results in December.

''Floor traffic surged during the opening half of the month, nearly 18 percent higher than a year ago,'' said a report
issued Monday by the marketing firm CNW Research.

For G.M., the investment announcement helps it end the year on yet another high note.

Last week, the Treasury Department said it had sold the last of the G.M. stock it took in exchange for the
government's $49.5 billion bailout of General Motors in 2009.

And the company also made history by naming Mary T. Barra to take over as chief executive in January,
becoming the first woman to rise to the top of a major automaker.

step in the company's reinvention since its bailout and bankruptcy four years ago.

''On that day, for the first time in decades, all eyes at General Motors pointed toward the future,'' Mr. Akerson said
in a wide-ranging speech at the National Press Club in Washington.

Industry analysts expect sales in the United States to be even better next year and automakers -- particularly
G.M., Ford and Chrysler, the third Detroit manufacturer -- are introducing new products to keep pace.

G.M. is expected to show its new midsize pickup truck, the GMC Canyon, at the Detroit auto show in January.
Chrysler, for its part, will take the wraps off a new Chrysler 200 sedan.

And while it will not confirm its plans, analysts predict that Ford will show off the latest version of the top-selling
vehicle in America, the F-150 pickup.

Ford executives said last week that despite the steady growth in overall sales, it was still difficult to gain even the
smallest amount of market share.

''The most important thing for us is to have vehicle choices for all these consumers,'' said Mark Fields, Ford's
chief operating officer.

The company is adding capacity at a number of plants, including its big truck factory in Kansas City, Mo. All
automakers are stretching the limits of their existing plants rather than building expensive new ones as sales
surge.

Ford said it would add about 5,000 jobs in the United States, most of which will be engineers and salaried
employees working on fuel-efficient engines and new technologies. The automaker is also building two new
factories in China and one in Brazil.

''This is the fastest and most aggressive manufacturing expansion the company has undergone in 50 years,'' said
John Fleming, Ford's global manufacturing chief.

The Detroit companies and their Japanese and German rivals gain a sizable portion of their corporate profits from
sales in the United States, where the market appears to be healthier than it has been in decades.

By drastically downsizing in recent years, the industry is matching its production to demand far better than in the
past. It is avoiding building large inventories of unsold cars, which can prompt sales discounts that eat away at
profits.

G.M. has reported 15 consecutive profitable quarters, which allows it the financial latitude to spend more money
on new products and plant improvements.

''We are in a capital-intensive business that demands steady and significant investment,'' Mr. Akerson said.
