News Corp. is paying $25 million to acquire Storyful, a social-media news

agency, the company said Friday.



The firm combs social-media outlets for both video and potential news stories,

which it then serves up to a range of clients, including news organizations and

ad agencies.



Both CEO Mark Little and Executive Editor David Clinch will remain with the

company. Storyful will become a separate entity within News Corp., which also

houses media brands including The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and

Barron's.



News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson said the move was aimed at accelerating the

digital transformation of the company.



"In a world overflowing with digital dross, Storyful surfaces and authenticates

news and video amidst the cacophony, using cutting-edge technology and

traditional journalistic expertise," Thomson said.

News Corp. reported Monday a net profit of $38 million in the quarter ended

Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $83 million a year earlier.



Revenue in the period fell 2.9 percent to $2.07 billion.



It was the first quarterly report from recently independent News Corp., which

separated most of its non-newspaper businesses into a new company called 21st

Century Fox in July.



Fox houses a Hollywood studio and cable and TV network operations.



"Our first quarter as the new News was the beginning of a journey in the digital

development of the company," CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement.



News Corp., whose publishing properties include The Post and the Wall Street

Journal, said the decline in revenue reflected a drop in demand for print

advertising, primarily in Australian publications.



First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or

Ebitda, rose 58 percent to $141 million.



Ebitda at the News and Information Services unit was up 6 percent, to $133

million, the company said in a statement.



Digital Real Estate Services, the second-largest segment, saw its Ebitda rise 26

percent to $44 million.



News Corp. also houses Australian newspapers and the digital real-estate

business among other assets such as Foxtel, a pay-TV venture.



News Corp. shares, up 10.3 percent since trading independently, fell 2.4 percent

in after hours trading following the release of the quarterly results.

News Corp. returned to profitability in the year ended June 30 as revenue

climbed 2.7 percent.



The publishing company, which owns the Wall Street Journal and The Post,

reported a profit of $506 million, or 87 cents a share, in the period, compared

with a loss of $2.08 billion a year earlier.



At the end of the fiscal year, News Corp. split into two publicly traded

companies - 21st Century Fox, which houses the TV, cable and entertainment

properties, and News Corp., which houses newspapers alongside book publisher

HarperCollins, Australian pay-TV assets such as FoxTel and an educational arm.



Revenue rose to $9 billion, according to the company's regulatory filing.



News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson has said he is planning to grow the print

publications through digital initiatives. The Wall Street Journal said Thursday

it is adding to its technology team and parting ways with the founders of

digital website, AllThingsD, Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg.



The company also said it will pay a dividend at some point in the future,

without specifying the date or the amount.



Shares fell 1.4 percent to $16.64 at the close in New York and have gained 5.3

percent since the split from 21st Century Fox in June.



The loss in the prior year resulted from a non-cash charge of $2.8 billion in

the fourth quarter of the 12 months ended June 2012, principally related to its

Australian newspaper business.
